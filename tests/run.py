"""The whole R test run in one command.

    python tests/run.py

Python, although the checks are R: the fixture server is Python anyway, and this way the
same mechanics serve both client packages. It also avoids what a shell script brings —
CRLF surprises on checkout, backgrounding and `kill` differing per system.

Two things it does that a one-liner would not, both because a CI failure has to explain
itself without a second run: it picks a FREE port instead of a fixed one, and when the
fixture server does not come up it prints what the server said. The Python package lost
a full CI cycle to a fixed port that a macOS runner already held.
